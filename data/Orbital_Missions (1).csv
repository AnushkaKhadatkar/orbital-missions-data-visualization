The mission lasted 1 day, 2 hours, 2 minutes & 17 seconds completing a total of 17 orbits around Earth. The mission had many issues, for example during his spacewalk his spacesuit ballooned up to a point where his suit became stiff. In order to move his limbs again and re-enter the airlock he had to bleed off some of the suit's pressure. After re-entering the capsule,the crew had trouble sealing the hatch, during re-entry the orbital module did not properly disconnect from the landing module causing the spacecraft to spin wildly until turbulence caused them to separate at around 100 km and the automatic landing system failed and the crew had to rely on the manual backup.

They replaced a gas analyzer, switched a pumping condenser in the water regeneration system with a hand pump & fixed a spectrometer. Mostly the experiments were biological & medical but they also studied stars, planets, earth and its atmosphere with roughly 2000 photographs of Earth and 600 of the sun taken.

During their stay on the station, crew conducted scientific experiments, inculding the first use of Kristall furnace for crystal growth, solar observations and experiments of military nature.
The mission was expected to last for 60 days, but emergincies occured on the 42nd day, which included shutdown of several onboard systems, oxygen regeneration system among those. Crew restored functionality of the spaceship, but both Volynov and Zholobov's health was deteriorated, and mission had to end early.

The mission began on June 6, 1985, 06:39:52 UTC, launching Commander Vladimir Dzhanibekov and Flight Engineer Viktor Savinykh into orbit. Following a two day solo flight Soyuz T-13 docked with Salyut 7 on June 08. When arriving there, the station had been vacant since eight month and it had been crippled by a solar array problem. Soyuz T-13 was the first Soyuz to dock manually with an inert Salyut. During their stay on the station, crew had to perform numerous repairs to restore life support, power and other systems, and conducted two EVAs for the same reasons. Cosmonauts were visited by a Progress cargo spacecraft and a Soyuz T-14, who joined the work on the station. Vladimir Dzhanibekov returned to Earth with the Soyuz T-14 crew member, while Viktor Savinykh stayed to continue his work on the station.

The mission began on January 24, 1993, 05:58:05 UTC, launching Commander Gennadi Manakov and Flight Engineer Alexander Poleshchuk into orbit. They docked with Mir two days later. During their stay there, cosmonauts performed EVAs, various station repair and maintenance tasks, and carried out scientific experiments in materials research, space technology, astrophysics and earth observation. One of the experiments was the deployment of a 20-m foil reflector, which was a  test of a future solar reflector designed to illuminate regions on the Earth's surface. Station crew was visited by several Progress resupply spacecrafts, and welcomed aboard the Soyuz TM-17 crew.

Atlantis lifted off from the launch pad at 19:38 EDT. Damage from a hail storm on 26 February 2007 had previously caused the launch to be postponed from an originally-planned launch date of 15 March 2007. The launch of STS-117 marked the 250th orbital human spaceflight.

0c0b4bb4-c3a9-4875-b350-dc90d052f8c2,H-IIA 202 | Akatsuki (Planet-C),2010,2010-05-20 21:58:22+00:00,Mitsubishi Heavy Industries,Commercial,H-IIA 202,H-II,Akatsuki (Planet-C),Planetary Science,"Planet-C or VCO (Venus Climate Orbiter, renamed Akatsuki after launch) is a Japanese Space Agency (JAXA) mission to study the dynamics of the atmosphere of Venus from orbit, particularly the upper atmosphere super-rotation and the three-dimensional motion in the lower part of the atmosphere, using multi-wavelength imaging. It will also measure atmospheric temperatures and look for evidence of volcanic activity and lightning. The scientific payload consists primarily of cameras in the near-infrared range.

The Planet-C main bus is a 1.6 m × 1.6 m × 1.25 m box with two solar array paddles, each with an area of 1.4 square meters, on opposite (+y and -y) sides and a 1.6 m high gain antenna on the +x side. On the opposite side (-x) from the antenna is a 0.45 m long orbital maneuvering engine. The total launch mass of the spacecraft will be 640 kg, including 320 kg of propellants and 34 kg of scientific instruments.

The spacecraft was to go into a near equatorial Venus orbit with an apoapsis of about 60,000 to 80,000 km and a very low periapsis.

On 7 December 2010, Akatsuki failed to enter orbit around Venus due to a malfunction in the propulsion system. An unexpected pressure drop in the spacecraft's fuel line, or possibly damage to the probe's engine nozzle, are the likely causes. JAXA plans to manoeuvre the probe to try it again five years later.

Tests of the engine in September 2011 resulted in low thrust. The back-up option is to use the RCS for orbit insertion. To enable this, the oxidizer needs to be dumped to reduce the weight of the probe. This will result in a less than optimal orbit. On 7 December 2015, another attempt to enter orbit was successful, this time using the RCS thrusters. It entered a 400 km × ~440000 km orbit of ~3° inclination with an orbital period of 13 days and 14 hours.

Also on board is IKAROS (Interplanetary Kite-craft Accelerated by Radiation Of the Sun), a experimental a solar sail. It is the world's first solar powered sail craft employing both photon propulsion and thin film solar power generation during its interplanetary cruise. After separation from the carrier rocket, it spun at up to 20 rpm, deploying the membrane and generating solar power by means of thin film solar cells (minimum success level) within several weeks. Acceleration and navigation using the solar sail will then be demonstrated (full success level) within half a year.

The shape of the membrane is square, with a diagonal distance of 20m. It is made of polyimide a mere 0.0075 mm thick. In addition to the thin film solar cells, the steering devices and dust-counter sensors are fitted to the membrane. The membrane is deployed, and kept flat, by its spinning motion. Four masses are attached to the four tips of the membrane in order to facilitate deployment. Deployment is in two stages. During the first stage, the membrane is deployed statically, and during the second stage, dynamically. This deployment method can be realized with simpler and lighter mechanisms than conventional mast or boom types as it does not require rigid structural elements.

After successfully unfolding the solar sail IKAROS deployed two tiny subsatellites called DCAM 1 and 2 to photograph the deployed sail.",Helio-N/A,Yoshinobu Launch Complex LP-1,"Tanegashima Space Center, Japan",JPN,Launch Successful,https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/h-iia_202_lifto_image_20240325123250.jpg,https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/0c0b4bb4-c3a9-4875-b350-dc90d052f8c2/?format=json,2023-09-08T09:07:41Z,2010-05-20T21:58:22Z

Water circulation changes will be observed by a microwave radiometer onboard the GCOM-W (Water) satellite (scheduled to be launched in Japan Fiscal Year 2011). The GCOM-W will observe precipitation, vapor amounts, wind velocity above the ocean, sea water temperatures, water levels on land areas and snow depths. Climate change observation will be performed by a multi-wavelength optical radiometer onboard the GCOM-C (Climate) satellite (under consideration) on clouds, aerosol, seawater color (marine organisms), vegetation, snow and ice. These satellites will enable us to perform comprehensive observations of the surface layer of the Earth such as the atmosphere, including clouds, land, oceans and the cryosphere.

The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) is a sensor to observe radiometers, or microwaves emitted naturally from the ground, sea surface and atmosphere, using 6 different frequency bands ranging from 7 GHz to 89 GHz. The strength of a natural microwave is determined by its characteristics and moisture, including the surface condition and temperature of the material. Although it depends on the frequency, the microwave is very weak. AMSR2 will detect such weak microwaves at an altitude of 700 kilometers and measure the strength of them with a very high accuracy. For example, by measuring the strength of a microwave emitted from the sea surface with the AMSR2, one can understand the water temperature of the sea surface to an accuracy of 0.5 degrees Celsius.",SSO,Yoshinobu Launch Complex LP-1,"Tanegashima Space Center, Japan",JPN,Launch Successful,https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/h-iia_202_lifto_image_20240325123250.jpg,https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/ae80cbc4-6b9f-4cb4-a278-532f10411a83/?format=json,2023-09-08T08:51:37Z,2012-05-17T16:39:00Z

It will provide broadband services to users in Africa and Europe.  The baseline mission of the satellite is to provide 75 Gbps of capacity across a network of 65 spotbeams that together provide quasi-complete coverage of Sub-Saharan Africa. The satellite will address direct-to-user consumer and enterprise broadband services using dishes from approximately 75 cm. It will also be used for community networks connected to Wi-Fi hotspots, mobile phone backhauling and rural connectivity.
Eutelsat Konnect is the first to use Thales Alenia Spaceâ€™s all-electric Spacebus NEO platform, developed under the Neosat Partnership Project conducted by the European and French space agencies (ESA and CNES). More robust, more modular, more powerful, more innovative, more flexible, this platform is perfectly adapted to operators' expectations in the evolving telecommunication market, and particlularly well positioned for very demanding VHTS missions. Eutelsat Konnect will allow the in-orbit validation of the complete end-to-end system of the new Spacebus Neo product line, including the fully-electric orbit-raising phase

The overall mission objective is to provide information for applications in cartography, land use, urban management, water management, environmental monitoring, risk management and security.

TARANIS (Tool for the Analysis of RAdiation from lightNIngand Sprites), the Celtic god of thunder and lightning, is the first satellite designed to observe luminous, radiative and electromagnetic phenomena occurring at altitudes of 20 to 100 km over thunderstorms. Discovered 20 years ago, such transient luminous events (TLEs) such as red sprites, blue jets, elves, sprite halos, etc. remain shrouded in mystery. They are sometimes accompanied by terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs). The TARANIS microsatellite will fly over thousands of TLEs and TGFs for at least four years and will be capable of detecting these events and recording their luminous and radiative signatures at high resolution, as well as the electromagnetic perturbations they set off in Earth’s upper atmosphere. The payload includes numerous sensors to observe the TLEs and to perform in-situ measurements of perturbations caused on the local plasma (fields, waves and particles).",SSO,Ariane Launch Area 1 (ELV),"Guiana Space Centre, French Guiana",GUF,Launch Failure,https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/vega_image_20201111143622.jpeg,https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/d9486816-bb61-4b16-bcfa-0d1e9ba40696/?format=json,2023-06-14T03:49:36Z,2020-11-17T01:52:20Z

The satellites span a range of operations, from TriSept’s tech demonstration of new tether systems designed to accelerate spacecraft reentry and reduce orbital debris, through to the next generation of maritime surveillance satellites for Unseenlabs, as well as communications satellites for Swarm. The mission will also deploy New Zealand’s first student-built satellite, the APSS-1 satellite for Te Pūnaha Ātea - Auckland Space Institute at The University of Auckland.

The DRAGRACER mission will test the effectiveness of new tether technologies designed to accelerate spacecraft reentry and reduce orbital debris at the conclusion of space missions. TriSept has completed the integration of a pair of qualified Millennium Space Systems 6U small satellites, one featuring the tether drag device and one without. The controlled spacecraft should deorbit in approximately 45 days, while the second spacecraft is expected to remain in orbit for seven to nine years.

BRO-2 and BRO-3 are the second and third satellites in French company Unseenlabs’ planned constellation of about 20 satellites dedicated to maritime surveillance. 

Swarm will launch the latest 24 1/4U SpaceBEE satellites to continue building out its planned constellation of 150 satellites to provide affordable satellite communications services to IoT devices in remote regions around the world.

DART is a planetary defense-driven test of one of the technologies for preventing the Earth impact of a hazardous asteroid: the kinetic impactor.  DART's primary objective is to demonstrate a kinetic impact on a small asteroid.  The binary near-Earth asteroid (65803) Didymos is the target for DART.   While Didymos' primary body is approximately 800 meters across, its secondary body has a 150-meter size, which is more typical of the size of asteroids that could pose a more common hazard to Earth.

The DART spacecraft will achieve the kinetic impact by deliberately crashing itself into the moonlet at a speed of approximately 6 km/s, with the aid of an onboard camera and sophisticated autonomous navigation software. The collision will change the speed of the moonlet in its orbit around the main body by a fraction of one percent, enough to be measured using telescopes on Earth.",Helio-N/A,Space Launch Complex 4E,"Vandenberg SFB, CA, USA",USA,Launch Successful,https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/falcon2520925_image_20211123182921.jpeg,https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/c4b2f90e-3385-4cbe-a89f-fc5f57da1bfb/?format=json,2024-03-05T18:13:40Z,2021-11-24T06:21:02Z

It consists of a dual mission to augment both L-band and Ka-band Global Xpress services.

Airbus Defence and Space has been awarded a contract by Inmarsat to design and develop the first two Inmarsat-6 (I-6) mobile communications satellites, creating the most versatile mobile services satellites in its fleet.

The two I-6 satellites are based on Airbus Defence and Space's Eurostar platform in its E3000e variant, which exclusively uses electric propulsion for orbit raising. The satellites take advantage of the reduction in mass that this electric propulsion technology enables for a dual payload mission, with an exceptionally large next generation digitally processed payload.

I-6 F1 and F2 both carry a large 9 m aperture L-band antenna and nine multibeam Ka-band antennas, and feature a high level of flexibility and connectivity. A new generation modular digital processor provides full routing flexibility over up to 8000 channels and dynamic power allocation to over 200 spot beams in L-band. Ka-band spot beams are steerable over the full Earth disk, with flexible channel to beam allocation.",GTO,Yoshinobu Launch Complex LP-1,"Tanegashima Space Center, Japan",JPN,Launch Successful,https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/h-iia_204_lifto_image_20240325124231.jpg,https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/e7f1ab18-908c-46b0-a16d-7deb6a52a8c1/?format=json,2023-06-14T03:53:07Z,2021-12-22T15:32:00Z

It will feature an X-band synthetic aperture radar.

StriX β is an upgraded version of the StriX α prototype. The satellite features two deployable panes, one side carrying solar cells, the other carrying the X-band radar antenna.

The StriX satellite constellation can target data with a ground resolution of 1-3 m, single polarized (VV), and a swath width of more than 10-30 km. The StriX observation modes are Stripmap and Sliding Spotlight mode and each satellite has an SAR antenna that is 5 meters in length and stowed during launch. The simple design of the satellites allows for affordable development of the constellation.

StriX β was planned to be launched in 2021 on a Soyuz-2-1a Fregat or Soyuz-2-1b Fregat rideshare mission, but as this mission was delayed, it was re-booked on a dedicated Electron KS launch.

Synspective is planning a constellation of 25 satellites called StriX, comprised of 100-kilogram satellites capable of imaging at a resolution of one to three meters. By 2022 the company plans to have six satellites in orbit.

It's the first space solar observatory of China.

ASO-S is a 3-axis stabilized satellite with a mass of less than 1,000 kg with a pointing accuracy of 0.01° and an orientation stability of 1 to 2 arc seconds every 20 seconds. The payload has a mass below 335 kg and consumes about 300 watts. The platform's pointing accuracy is lower than 0.01°, the measurement accuracy is lower than 1 arc second and the orientation drift is below 0.0004°/s.

ASO-S has three instruments:

- The Full-Disc Vector Magnetograph (FMG) instrument is intended to map the magnetic field of the photosphere over the entire solar disk. It includes an imager, an optical polarization system and a CCD detector.

- The Hard X-ray Imager (HXI) camera should image the whole solar disk in X-rays. The instrument is optimized to take images of solar flares.

These includes tidal disruption events (stars pulled apart by supermassive black holes), supernovae, and high-energy, electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave events.

The spacecraft, weighing ~1400 kilograms, will be launched into a 600-kilometer-high, low-inclination orbit. The probe's instruments include a Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) with a field of view of 3,600 square degrees, employing cutting-edge ""lobster eye"" optics to view X-ray events more deeply and widely than previously possible, and a Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT), developed in collaboration with Europe, that performs follow-up detailed observations as soon as WXT detects an X-ray event.

The Einstein Probe mission is managed by the NSSC, with participation from the CAS's NAOC, the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP), the Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics (SITP), and the Innovation Academy for Microsatellites, a spacecraft manufacturer that has previously produced space science and Beidou navigation spacecraft.

The European Space Agency is contributing to the mission with a mirror module for the FXT instrument, as well as ground station and science management support.

The Strela (Russian: Стрела) are Soviet, then Russian, military space telecommunication satellites, in use since 1964.

These satellites operate as mailboxes (""store-and-forward""): they remember the received messages and then resend them after the scheduled time, or by a command from the Earth. They can serve for up to five years. The satellites are used for transmission of encrypted messages and images.

The operational constellation consists of 12 satellites in two orbital planes, spaced 90° apart. The spacecraft had a cylindrical body with a gravity-gradient boom, which was extended on-orbit to provide passive attitude stabilization. On-board storage was 12 Mbits of data, with a transmission rate of 2.4 kbit/s.

The first three satellites were launched in 1964 by a Cosmos launcher. After one year of service, new and improved satellites were launched, called Strela-2. In 1970, these satellites were modernized, and became the Strela-1M and Strela-2M satellites. From 1985, these satellites will be gradually replaced by Strela-3, and then by Strela-3M from 2005. A civilian version of these satellites was created, called Goniets.

Initially they were launched in groups of six on Tsyklon; when the launcher was retired, they were only launched by two on Cosmos, before Rokot was put into service and allowed the sending of triplets of Strela satellites.",LEO,35/1,"Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russian Federation",RUS,Launch Successful,https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/angara25201.2_image_20190224012254.jpeg,https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/318df8ac-45a8-402b-a164-8bb7032601fd/?format=json,2025-04-17T04:17:18Z,2025-03-16T10:49:26Z
